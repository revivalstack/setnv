# setnv: Your .env files, supercharged.

> Effortless environment variable loading and management for any workflow.

Manage your application's environment variables with simplicity and power. `setnv` helps you centralize configuration and sensitive data in easy-to-use `.env` files, supporting dynamic variable expansion and seamless secret integration. It also supports chaining multiple `.env` files, allowing for layered configurations.

## Quick Example

Store your kopia environment variables in a `myconfig.env` file, and use `setnv` to call kopia with the resolved environment variables including gopass secrets.

```bash
setnv myconfig kopia [kopia-params]
```

- `setnv` looks for a `myconfig.env` file in current directory, or in `~/.config/setnv/myconfig.env`
- reads `myconfig.env` file and loads `KEY=VALUE` pairs, e.g. `KOPIA_PASSWORD=$(gopass show test/KOPIA_PASSWORD)`
- pass these resolved `KEY=VALUE` pairs to `kopia <params>`

For layered configurations, you can chain multiple `.env` files. For example, `default.env` defines default settings, and `myconfig.env` overrides some variables in the default:

```bash
setnv default,myconfig kopia [kopia-params]
```

## Features

- **Chained Configuration**: Specify multiple `.env` files (e.g., `id1,id2,id3`). Variables from later files in the chain override those from earlier ones, enabling powerful layered configurations.
- **Intelligent `.env` Parsing**: Reads `KEY=VALUE` pairs, gracefully skipping comments and empty lines.
- **Smart Value Handling**: Supports both double-quoted values (with full escape sequence support like `\n`, `\"`) and literal single-quoted values.
- **Robust Variable Expansion**: Resolve `$VAR` and `${VAR}` references within your `.env` file. It handles recursive expansions and prevents infinite loops from circular dependencies, resolving unresolvable variables to empty strings with a warning.
- **Seamless Gopass Integration**: Directly inject secrets from your `gopass` store using `$(gopass show <path>)` or `$(gopass <path>)` syntax. This is a **specially handled command substitution** for convenient secret retrieval, keeping sensitive data out of plain text.
- **Command Substitution**: Dynamically set variable values by executing shell commands and capturing their standard output. `setnv` supports two main syntaxes for general command execution:

  - `$(command args)`: The traditional shell command substitution syntax, e.g., `MY_VAR=$(echo "hello")`. While supported, this syntax has **limitations with complex nested shell syntax** (e.g., unquoted parentheses or backticks) within the command string.

  - `$[command args]`: **Recommended for robust command execution**, especially when your commands include internal parentheses, backticks, or other complex shell constructs. Example: `APP_VERSION=$[git describe --tags --abbrev=0]` or `COMPLEX_CMD=$[echo "Current time is $(date) (GMT)"]`.

- **Flexible Execution Modes**:

  - **Execute a Command**: Load variables and run a specified executable with its arguments, with the environment isolated to that process.

  - **Launch a Subshell**: Load variables and open a new interactive shell, handy for development sessions.

  - **Export to Current Shell**: Generate `export` commands for `eval`ing the environment directly into your active shell session.

  - **View Variables**: Safely display the fully resolved environment variables before applying them, useful for debugging.

- **Environment Sandboxing (`--sandboxed`)**: Control whether `setnv` passes inherited system environment variables to the target process. With `--sandboxed`, only variables explicitly defined in your `.env` files are passed, creating a clean, isolated environment.
- **Portable & Minimal**: Built in Go, `setnv` compiles into a single, self-contained binary, ensuring easy distribution and minimal external dependencies.

## How Does It Work?

`setnv` first locates your `.env` file(s) based on the provided IDs, prioritizing the current directory before checking a central configuration directory (e.g., `~/.config/setnv/`). When chaining multiple IDs (e.g., `base,dev`), files are processed in order, with later files overriding variables defined in earlier ones. It then meticulously reads each line, parsing key-value pairs, handling quoted strings, and executing `gopass` commands or other shell commands to fetch dynamic values.

After the initial parsing and command substitutions, `setnv` performs an iterative variable expansion process, resolving all `$VAR` and `${VAR}` references within the loaded environment variables, handling nesting and detecting circularities. Finally, based on your chosen mode and the `--sandboxed` flag:

- For running executables or launching subshells, `setnv` uses `syscall.Exec` to replace its own process with the target command, ensuring the environment is seamlessly passed. The environment passed includes variables from `.env` files, optionally merged with the inherited system environment based on the `--sandboxed` flag.
- For exporting variables, it prints shell-compatible `export` commands to standard output.
- For viewing, it simply prints the resolved variables to your terminal.

## Why `setnv`?

While other tools exist for managing `.env` files, `setnv` aims to be a minimal, self-contained Go binary that's easy to distribute and use, especially in environments where installing Python or Node.js dependencies might be cumbersome. It provides built-in `gopass` integration for those who manage secrets with it, and clear modes of operation for various workflows. Its ability to chain multiple `.env` files and offer sandboxed execution provides powerful flexibility for complex configurations.

## Installation

You can build `setnv` from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/revivalstack/setnv.git
cd setnv
go build -o setnv .
sudo mv setnv /usr/local/bin/
```

or via

```bash
go install github.com/revivalstack/setnv@latest
```

## Usage

Environment files are expected to be located in `~/.config/setnv/<id>.env`.
You can override the base configuration directory by setting the `LOAD_ENV_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.

### Basic `.env` File Example (`~/.config/setnv/myproject.env`)

```Code snippet
# My project's environment variables
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASS=$(gopass show myproject/database/password) # Fetches password from gopass
BUILD_ID=$[date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S]                      # Example of robust command substitution using $[]
API_KEY="supersecret_key_with_\"quotes\""
APP_URL=http://$DB_HOST:$DB_PORT/app
MESSAGE='This is a literal string with $ and \' characters.'
```

### Chaining .env Files

To load `base.env` then `dev.env`, with `dev.env` overriding variables from `base.env`:

```bash
setnv base,dev myapp-script.sh
```

### Running an Executable

To load variables for `myproject` and then run a command:

```bash
setnv myproject node index.js --port 3000
```

### Launching a Subshell

To load variables for `myproject` and launch a new interactive shell:

```bash
setnv myproject
```

### Exporting to Current Shell

To load variables for `myproject` into your current shell session (variables will persist):

```bash
eval "$(setnv myproject --export)"
```

**Warning**: Variables exported this way are visible in your shell's environment (`env`, `ps e`) and can persist across commands. Use with caution for sensitive data.

### Viewing Variables

To see the resolved environment variables for `myproject` without running any commands:

```bash
setnv myproject --view
```

**Warning**: This will print plaintext secrets (if any are resolved from `gopass`) to your terminal.

### Sandboxed Execution

To run a command with _only_ the environment variables defined in `myproject.env`, ignoring inherited system environment variables (unless overridden):

```bash
setnv myproject --sandboxed bash -c 'echo "PATH: $PATH, MY_VAR: $MY_VAR"'
# MY_VAR will be whatever is in myproject.env, PATH will likely be empty if not explicitly set there.
```

### Version and Help

```bash
setnv --version
setnv --help
```

### Integration with Container Runtimes (Podman & Docker)

Seamlessly inject `setnv`'s variables into your containers:

1.  **Via `--env-file` (Podman or Docker):**
    Use `setnv --view` with your shell's process substitution (`<()`) to stream resolved variables as an environment file to your container runtime. This is the most robust method for both Podman and Docker.

    ```bash
    # For Podman:
    podman run --rm --env-file <(setnv base,dev --view) alpine env

    # For Docker:
    docker run --rm --env-file <(setnv base,dev --view) alpine env
    ```

    - _Note:_ Requires shells supporting process substitution (e.g., Bash, Zsh).
    - _Security:_ Output (including secrets) is streamed, not printed to terminal, but the command remains visible in shell history and process lists.

2.  **Via `--env-host` (Podman only):**
    Have `setnv` directly execute the `podman run` command. Use `--env-host` flag if you want environment variables set by `setnv` (and other host variables) to be passed into the container.

    ```bash
    # setnv sets env for the 'podman' process, and '--env-host' passes them to 'alpine'
    setnv base,dev podman run --rm --env-host alpine printenv
    ```
